            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>At Pawsome Pet Nutrition, we believe that every dog deserves the best start in life, and that begins with a nutritious diet. Our journey started in a small kitchen, where our founder, a passionate pet parent and nutritionist, began experimenting with homemade recipes for her beloved Labrador, Max. Frustrated with the lack of transparency and quality in commercial dog foods, she set out to create something better. What began as a labor of love for one dog has since blossomed into a mission to provide healthy, wholesome food for dogs everywhere.</p>
